# streetcar

This project uses the DOM to add animations to a map. Specifically, this project maps the route of the Atlanta streetcar, which is a popular method of transportation in the metro Atlanta area.

How to run: Drag the html file onto a new tab in a browser. Click the button on the top left and it will show you the route of the streetcar.

Improvements: A live tracker of the streetcar could be added by adding live latitude and longitudes of the streetcar.
